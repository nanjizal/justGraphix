UNSTABLE WIP  
  
Haxe graphics library to draw shapes using triangles or pixels.  
  
Decoupled for use with.  
- OpenFL  
- LIME  
- NME  
- Ceramic  
- Heaps  
- Kha  
- WebGL  
- Canvas  
  
It is not new collating several of my projects.  
  
- Note licence may need tweeks as some code was based on MIT libraries written in other language.  Probably need to reference an AUTHORS file from the license giving details, not sure need a separate MIT License for each part as they were my ports to Haxe.  
  
current incomplete generated dox can be found

There are currently no example use cases. It has not been tested in it's current form, but all the package compiles durring creation of dox, a good sign, and the original separate libraries all had example that worked.  
  
```Tested against Haxe Compiler 5.0.0-alpha.1+1423a5f```
   
Still required some haxe WebGL/html helpers for JS examples. Currently only has core functionality.
